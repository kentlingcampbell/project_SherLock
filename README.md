Sherlock vs Moriarty: A smartphone dataset for cybersecurity research.


This project will look into applying a yet to be determined approach or set of approaches to capture the Moriarty actions.  The data can be found at <link broken, Dave?> [Project Website](http://bigdata.ise.bgu.ac.il/sherlock/) or a 2 week subset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/BGU-CSRC/sherlock). 

A paper discussing this dataset can be found at [Mirsky et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2996758.2996764?casa_token=E9wxVhbwsz8AAAAA:uSv_OH8chsX91Ei1DSNmN9jGT9uyfwdccrj2ix6P2D09377jjD7OTGzO0pEvU5Vf0N-iaSg7BgBcyg).
